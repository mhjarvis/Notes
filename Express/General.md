# General

* [Express Website](https://expressjs.com/)

Express is a web framework for Node.js. It is a NPM package which comes with methods and plugins that can be used to build web applications and APIs. Express can help:

- Start up a server and listen for requests
- Parse incoming requests
- Match requests to particular routes
- Craft http response and associated content

## Framework versus Library
When using a LIBRARY, the flow of the application code is left up to you. In a FRAMEWORK, the control is inverted; the framework is in charge and tells you where to plug in the code.
