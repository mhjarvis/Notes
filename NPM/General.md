# General Information
NPM is really two things:

1. A library of thousands of packages published by other developers that we can use for free. 
2. A command line tool to easily install and manage those packages in our Node projects.

NPM helps track all of the dependencies or other packages that our software depends on. It also makes it easy to install all fo the dependencies.
