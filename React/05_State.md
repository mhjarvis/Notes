# General

Because apps will change over time - whether being changed by a button or updating information received from an API - React provides primitives to help manipulate the state of your apps, making them dynamic.

## What is `state` in React

State is a components memory - it allows components to 'remember' things about itself. 




* All functions in React that start with 'use' (e.g. useState) are considered hooks.
    1. Only call Hooks inside of Component Functions
    2. Only call Hooks on the top level.
