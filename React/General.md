# General


React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is declarative, meaning you define the target UI state(s), not the steps for how to get there.

# Components
Components are the main building blocks of React. Put together, these are what build websites / webapps. These components wrap HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and anything else used. You create small building blocks and use them to compose the UI, thus allowing reuse.
