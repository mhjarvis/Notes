<h1 style="text-align:center">AJAX & APIs</h1>

## AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
AJAX essentially refers to the concept of making requests to load information or save information behind the scenes on a website (e.g. getting information from a server). It also allows for things such as live search, or doing things on a webpage without reloading everything. 

## JSON ()
Most information that is returned to you via APIs will be in JSON (this used to be XML, which is rarely used today).
